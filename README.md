<h1 align="center">From procedural to OOP - Student code review #2</h1>

<p align="center">This project is showing usage of Object Oriented principles, mainly its four pillars in real life code - by commenting on one student project. </p>

Anonymous student Michael is struggling with maintaining this project due to its architecture. He also wants to start working as an expert in some company as he has five years of coding experience. 

This project is quite successful and has a lot of users, but its architecture could be improved and simplified, and Object-Oriented paradigm could reduce code duplication, as well as improve code readability and re-usability. This project is a great opportunity to go over four pillars of OOP:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction 
- Inheritance and
- Polymorphism

To work in larger companies on senior positions where he will teach other programmers programming, Michael needs to improve his skills and understanding of OOP as it is used in pretty much all popular applications and frameworks.
